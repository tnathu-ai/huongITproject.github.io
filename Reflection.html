In all circumstances, I have attempted to consummate my tasks and not upset others. That implies that I cautiously research the data so I can add more to my work. To lay it out plainly, I am a person fulfilling my role. One thing I need to improve my work routine. I invest a great deal of energy finishing my tasks and it's an excess of now and then. I need to figure out how to control my time so I can accelerate my work with the goal that I don't influence others. At the point when the advancement of the work is pushed up, others will feel greater when my part is prepared and give them a wellspring of inspiration for them to accelerate to find what I am doing. I was amazed when I first accepted the role of doing the assigned tasks however turned into the chosen one and it was an incredible experience. Last but not least, what I gained from working in a group is to try not to purchase quick nourishments like snacks as it can cause us to feel lethargic.&nbsp;With regards to teaming, it is hard to manage everything well, except my group has worked viably together. While doing this, everybody will be upbeat and lift profitability. As an outcome, we made some great memories working and we upheld each other well indeed. Nonetheless, I feel that the speed of the working process has not been compelling. Everybody should begin working early instead of postponing time, as it puts a strain on us as the cutoff time approaches and we will feel in a rush to cooperate.&nbsp;<br>
                              <br>Furthermore, when meeting, everybody should concentrate more, don't be occupied by the encompassing issues just as a spotlight on the gathering's work and associate with everybody. What I'm glad about working with this group is that even though things are late, everybody is urging each other to work out the best. At the point when everybody concurs this way, cooperating will be extremely snappy and successful. The uplifting statements from everybody are the main impetus for all to have the option to accomplish the best work and the outcomes are because of the endeavors of every individual. Besides, the calmness when working is also a strong point to mention, we calmly work together despite time is very fast, it is the calmness that makes each person more confident in the section. do their own and contribute to the overall achievement of the group.&nbsp;<br>
                              <br>On the contrary, the thing my group needs to improve the most is self-awareness. We have to be self-conscious to increase the work progress as well as the working time. Only when there is a push from the other members or a deadline can my team focus on the assigned assignment and get it done. If everyone had self-discipline before, everything would have been extremely smooth and brisk, it was not close to the cutoff time to begin finding out about it. This will be a great lesson for everybody in the group and me. Sometime later, I will give myself mindfulness so I can work with everybody and uphold each other to create.&nbsp; </b>

This is the first time that I work with a group at university, generally, everything happened well totally, arguments rarely occurred. I could see that all the members understood and respected each other, because of that, the solidarity between us has become more sustainable. Although there are some issues incurred during the process, we always try to complete it perfectly. The final product is not only for our assignment but also for the efforts and determination. Furthermore, the comfortable atmosphere is always maintained throughout the project, this has made everybody feel enjoyable and not be so stressed.However, there are some problems which need to be improved for the group to be better.&nbsp;</b>
                            <br>
                            <br><b style="">The most important is attending on time, in fact, most of our meetings have been delayed from 30 to 45 minutes. First, the meetings are usually held at 8:30 AM, as a consequence, it is difficult for everyone to get up early because we need to finish the assignments not only in Intro to IT but also other subjects. Second, my home and Trang are quite far from RMIT, it takes 35 minutes on average to come to the campus. In spite of that, we did not let the problem affect the entire project, all the goals that were set on that day were always accomplished.One thing that impressed me a lot was the chemistry between each member. Although this is the first time we work together, I can feel that everyone has known each other for a long time.&nbsp;<br>
                              <br>For example, when Thu showed the idea at the beginning of the project, we agreed immediately and began to make the plan. Surprisingly, the plan was also the same as Thu expected, until now, we are still focusing on that proposal to build and develop our product.I am truly honored to be a part of this fantastic team; be​sides that, I have learned a lot from my marvelous members. The person that I want to mention the most is Thu, in all honesty, she is an intelligent girl with a strong personality. I have never seen a girl that was very at coding like her before, nevertheless, she never appeared arrogant. Thu always helps each other when they face a difficulty, furthermore, she sometimes shares the knowledge when studying abroad. The lesson that I have been taught from her is to try to be more extroverted, because if we talk and listen from others, we can figure out a large number of unprecedented things.</b>

                          <p class="u-custom-font u-heading-font u-text u-text-2"><b style="">Over the past 3 months, the five of us have been working together over multiple assignments. From that, I was able to have a close look at each person’s performance. Overall, I am very satisfied with our team’s and each member’s progress. We always made it in time for the deadlines despite having busy schedules. Even when problems arised, we did not hold vicious thoughts against one another, but rather face the issues vis-à-vis. Because of it, there weren’t any serious misunderstandings in our team, so the atmosphere was always straight forward and enjoyable.&nbsp;<br>
                              <br>However, there is one thing that I feel like could be improved, which is the content in our meetings. From time to time we would meet up and talk about what we should do next. But sometimes, we got distracted in the middle of it and ended up going nowhere. Even though this did not happen all the time, it could still have a negative effect on our project, like late submission for example.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                              <br>During our time working together, one thing that surprised me the most was the fact that everything went really well despite each member having their own opinions. Usually when it comes to teamwork, it is expected that all members have the same mindset and viewpoint in order to head in the right direction. When I first met my team, it was clear from the beginning that we had very contrasting ideas.&nbsp;However, once we were past that, everyone got along and worked smoothly.Being able to participate in a wonderful team, I have learned so much from my teammates that will definitely help me in the future.&nbsp;<br>
                              <br>Take Huy for example. Huy took 4 courses this semester, which means he had more deadlines, more assignments than the others. However, he never refused to work and always did his parts properly. He was a role model and a responsible teammate as well. From him, I learned how to be flexible on my timetable so that I could do many things at the same time without feeling overwhelmed.&nbsp; </b>

In all circumstances, I have attempted to consummate my tasks and not upset others. That implies that I cautiously research the data so I can add more to my work. To lay it out plainly, I am a person fulfilling my role. One thing I need to improve my work routine. I invest a great deal of energy finishing my tasks and it's an excess of now and then. I need to figure out how to control my time so I can accelerate my work with the goal that I don't influence others. At the point when the advancement of the work is pushed up, others will feel greater when my part is prepared and give them a wellspring of inspiration for them to accelerate to find what I am doing. I was amazed when I first accepted the role of doing the assigned tasks however turned into the chosen one and it was an incredible experience. Last but not least, what I gained from working in a group is to try not to purchase quick nourishments like snacks as it can cause us to feel lethargic.&nbsp;With regards to teaming, it is hard to manage everything well, except my group has worked viably together. While doing this, everybody will be upbeat and lift profitability. As an outcome, we made some great memories working and we upheld each other well indeed. Nonetheless, I feel that the speed of the working process has not been compelling. Everybody should begin working early instead of postponing time, as it puts a strain on us as the cutoff time approaches and we will feel in a rush to cooperate.&nbsp;</b>
                            <br>
                            <br><b style="">Furthermore, when meeting, everybody should concentrate more, don't be occupied by the encompassing issues just as a spotlight on the gathering's work and associate with everybody. What I'm glad about working with this group is that even though things are late, everybody is urging each other to work out the best. At the point when everybody concurs this way, cooperating will be extremely snappy and successful. The uplifting statements from everybody are the main impetus for all to have the option to accomplish the best work and the outcomes are because of the endeavors of every individual. Besides, the calmness when working is also a strong point to mention, we calmly work together despite time is very fast, it is the calmness that makes each person more confident in the section. do their own and contribute to the overall achievement of the group. On the contrary, the thing my group needs to improve the most is self-awareness. We have to be self-conscious to increase the work progress as well as the working time. Only when there is a push from the other members or a deadline can my team focus on the assigned assignment and get it done. If everyone had self-discipline before, everything would have been extremely smooth and brisk, it was not close to the cutoff time to begin finding out about it. This will be a great lesson for everybody in the group and me. Sometime later, I will give myself mindfulness so I can work with everybody and uphold each other to create.&nbsp; </b>

I have to note two members pitched their views, while the other three agreed to what the first two members suggested and added their perspectives. Our subject, one for each member, was divided into five sections. To contribute to the presentation, each participant was responsible for researching their part of the assignment. We contacted via Messenger, Zoom after the first meeting and after everyone was done with their research process. Our report was submitted to a member responsible for bringing all the details together for our first draft.</b>
                        <br>
                        <br><b style="">We were checking our PowerPoint, and GitHub can be hard to get group members all on the same page. We ensured that we had the situation taken care of in our subject. Eventually, we chose when our next gathering ought to be. The third and last gathering was short. We examined our introduction and our parts in the introduction. There were no new proposals from the individuals right now.&nbsp;</b>
                        <br>
                        <br><b style="">Doling out parts made it simpler for us to investigate. However, it likewise implied that we had restricted information in the introduction since we centered around our parts. We ought to have met when the other part made the gathering's report instead of sending the data to us and allowing us to accomplish all the work. I likewise need to take note that our gathering did not set up any objectives. These are fundamental whether they are close to home or gathering objectives since they permit individuals to know where they are going.</b>
                        <br>
                        <br><b style="">Another issue that I had with the gathering was that we did not have any leader. There is no uncertainty that pioneers assume a fundamental part in gatherings. These individuals are the ones that the remainder of the individuals turn upward to and tune in to concerning what should be finished. The pioneer unites the entire gathering. This individual's off chance demonstrates insufficient, almost certainly, the gathering will fizzle in their objectives. Nonetheless, having no pioneer can likewise imply that the group sees each other as equivalents and that everybody can propose or suggest something, which the gathering can choose.&nbsp;</b>
                        <br>
                        <br><b style="">I accept that my gathering worked hard. We had many issues and ourselves, yet I do not think we are the lone gathering who experienced it. Nonetheless, I believe that my gathering and the individuals have far to improve working with a gathering and introducing work before a huge crowd. I feel that individuals should bond and become acquainted with one another before cooperating, which we did quite well. This will make them more all right with one another and permit them to open up and share what they need to state. It is additionally better if the individuals consistently update each other with the advancement of their work. The gathering should set aside the effort to meet and talk about the exploration and future issues that they may experience as a gathering. It would be a smart thought if the individuals get together and practice the introduction cycle or realize the introduction stream not to seem amateurish.</b>
                        <br>
                        <br><b style="">The last gathering included us testing our presentation on an AR&nbsp; video demo. Having people group individuals together on the same wavelength can be testing. We ensured we had the situation taken care of in our topic. We, in the long run, concurred when our next gathering would have been. There was a short third and last gathering. In the introduction, we tended to our introduction and our parts. Right now, we cooperate smoothly with many groundbreaking ideas.</b>
