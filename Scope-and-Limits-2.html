From my perspective, our team has worked hard from the very beginning, especially at the time close to the deadline, where everyone pulled up 101% of their power. Here are some of my thought on each member’s performance:</b>
                    <br>
                    <br><b style="">Nguyen Hai Minh Trang: Trang always shows enthusiasm and confidence about our project. She is passionate, flexible and also intelligent. In fact, Trang was the one who came up with the idea of our presentation. Sometimes she even stayed up until 3 AM to finish her part and it shows her determination. Whenever there is something she does not understand, she takes no hesitation in digging deeper into the problems until the results that she wants are out. Overall, I am very happy to be a part of the team with her.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br><b style="">Tran Ngoc Anh Thu: Thu is a sweet and thoughtful person. She deals with problems in a light way instead of taking things in a serious manner, and it helps create a comfortable atmosphere for our group. Aside from that, she is also very responsible with work. She would take charge of the group’s process and push the members to do their best so that we don’t fall behind. She is always willing to do more work if that is what it takes. All in all, her good work ethic is what I admire most and it motivates me to do better in the future.Min Chi Gia Khiem: Khiem is not a talkative guy. During our meetings, he rarely says anything but he does not let that define all of his performance. He always shows up on time, raises his voice when it is needed and cares a lot about the group’s progress. None of us has ever needed to complain about his work since the quality is impressive. Overall, I am really excited to see his projects in the future and looking forward to working with him again.</b>

                  <p class="u-align-right u-text u-text-5"><b>Nguyen Xuan Huy: Huy surprises me with his good work ethic. He manages to stay calm in the middle of the chaos, being the reliable person that every team needs. He is not afraid of the heavy workload despite taking 4 courses this semester. For a newbie, I could not imagine how he gets through all of the deadlines and stress without complaining. I believe that his effort and determination help him to go further in the future.<br>
                      <br>About myself: I think I have fulfilled my role as a member in the team. I completed my tasks on time and did not run away from extra work. I participated in all of the group meetings and consultations if I was able to as well as raising my thoughts. However, in comparison to other people in the group, I feel like I need to step up my game and do better. I only did my job properly, but people would expect me to think outside of the box and be outstanding. Next, since I am somewhat disorganized, I need to manage my time better in order to achieve the best. All in all, there are still many things that need improvement, however I am very proud of what I have done so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

However, I can understand and sympathize with him since he has to study 4 courses this semester.</b>

                    <br>
                    <br><b>However, there are some problems which need to be improved for the group to be better. The most important is attending on time, in fact, most of our meetings have been delayed from 30 to 45 minutes. First, the meetings are usually held at 8:30 AM, as a consequence, it is difficult for everyone to get up early because we need to finish the assignments not only in Intro to IT but also other subjects. Second, my home and Trang are quite far from RMIT, it takes 35 minutes on average to come to the campus. In spite of that, we did not let the problem affect the entire project, all the goals that were set on that day were always accomplished.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br><b>One thing that impressed me a lot was the chemistry between each member. Although this is the first time we work together, I can feel that everyone has known each other for a long time. For example, when Thu showed the idea at the beginning of the project, we agreed immediately and began to make the plan. Surprisingly, the plan was also the same as Thu expected, until now, we are still focusing on that proposal to build and develop our product.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br><b>I am truly honored to be a part of this fantastic team; besides that, I have learned a lot from my marvelous members. The person that I want to mention the most is Thu, in all honesty, she is an intelligent girl with a strong personality. I have never seen a girl that was very at coding like her before, nevertheless, she never appeared arrogant. Thu always helps each other when they face a difficulty, furthermore, she sometimes shares the knowledge when studying abroad. The lesson that I have been taught from her is to try to be more extroverted, because if we talk and listen from others, we can figure out a large number of unprecedented things.</b>

Thu is a hard-working person. She usually works hard to submit her workload on time. She
also volunteers for some heavy workload such as ‘Time frame’ or creating GitHub website for the
report. Although, she loses her temper sometime in group meeting (mostly by me), due to the late
attendant of another group member. But after calming herself, she will cooperate with another
member normally.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>3.2. Nguyen Hai Minh Trang:
Trang also a hard-working person. She always looks for new task after finishing her
workload. Sometimes she had to stay up late to finish her work. Moreover, she also assists another
member in the group when they were in trouble by providing a good advice or comments for their
work. She also helps me to write Application part in Database. Overall, I do not have any
comments on her work or attitude, because she is a responsible person.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>3.3. Min Chi Gia Khiem:
In my opinion, Khiem has a wide range of knowledge in IT field. I was surprise about his
presentation, because there were some parts that I did not know or explore before. Moreover, he 
42
is very active in group meeting, he has attended to every group meeting that we had created.
However, I think Khiem need to be more active in group work, so the group activity will be highly
increased.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>3.4. Phan Do Ngoc Linh:
Linh is very funny and talkative. She brings the harmony to the group and control the group
moderation. Moreover, she is a hard-working person, she always tries her best to submit her work
before the group deadline. However, if Linh pay attention more to the group meeting, she can push
the group productivity and spirit to the next level.&nbsp;<br>

                    </span>3.5 Nguyen Xuan Huy (me):
In opinion, I would define me as a lazy but chill person. If I tried to start working on the
project sooner, I would improve the project quality and project demo to the next level. Due to my
subjectivity, I often start to work on my part at the day that near the deadline. So, I think I need to
learn how to manage my time and get rid of distraction.&nbsp;<br>

Starting from week 9, online sessions will be held weekly on Friday via Teams, members must update their tasks and demonstrate how many that they have done, there will be troubleshooting at the end of the assembly additionally.

After the break, we have considered discussing the plan on Wednesday and Friday each week at RMIT. During the discussion, we can clarify each person's idea much better than the online one, this is also an opportunity for all teammates to cultivate, test the project and learn from each other. For example, we can share our codes and check if it can run smoothly on each laptop. We estimate until January 23rd, there will be 8 meetings organized, besides, on January 16th and 23rd, we have an extra conversation for all the members to double-check everything before the due date of Assignment 3.</b>

The rules of the group allow one person to have the maximum of two absent days , the reason we do that is because it is difficult to oblige everyone participating in all the meetings. This also includes online meetings, if they miss more than two days, we will examine the contribution rating of that member and decrease it. In addition, we have to send a message or call them to remind them. But we hope that everyone can manage their time appropriately so they will attend in all the meetings.</b>
